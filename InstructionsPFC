Instructions for Post-Fix Calculator: 
 For this assignment, you are going to implement a postfix calculator using a Stack. The 
application must be a GUI application, allowing the user to enter operands (the numbers) and 
operators as a string into the display window. When the user clicks the “Calculate” button, the 
application will attempt to perform the calculation. If it cannot, an appropriate error should be 
displayed. Examples of exceptions would be a division by zero attempt, or an incorrectly formed 
postfix string for an equation.
